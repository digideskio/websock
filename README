What is it?
-----------
gwsocket is a standalone, simple, yet powerful rfc6455 compliant WebSocket
Server, written in C.

Why?
----
I needed a simple, fast, no-dependencies, RFC6455 compliant WebSocket Server
written in C that I could use as a library for the upcoming version (v1.0) of
GoAccess by simply piping data in and out.

Features
-------
* Message Fragmentation per section 5.4
* UTF-8 Handling
* Framing (Text & Binary messages)
* Multiplexed non-blocking network I/O
* Ability to pipe data in/out in two different modes (stdin/stdout & strict mode)
* It passes the Autobahn Testsuite :)
* and of course, Valgrind tested.
* missing something?, please feel free to post it on Github.

How it Works?
-------------
Very simple, just pipe your data out of your application and let gwsocket do
the rest. e.g.: tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log > /tmp/wspipein.fifo

By the way, you can also pipe the client's data into your application.

Note: You can even send your favorite NCurses program's output. See
https://github.com/allinurl/gwsocket.
